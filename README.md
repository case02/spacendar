## Approach Taken towards MVP and Completion
During the initial stages of planning, our team was eager to get started and had ideas flying left and right of how we wanted to create our 'photo of the day' calendar. Looking back, we still believe a lot of our initial ideas were good ones, but we just did not have the time or resources to be able to complete them before the due date. We used a lot of mob-coding on the frontend to make sure our entire group was on the same page with each component and page. Throughout the project week, we came to realize that creating an entire year calendar would be more difficult. So, we decided to only use the month of December from our NASA APOD API.
