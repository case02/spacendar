## User Stories:
- As an aspiring astronaut, Spacendar allows me to discover a new image of the universe every day and comment and share with my friends.
- As a parent to a child who is interested in space, we are able to start each morning with a lesson about what the daily image shows and do our own research on where it came from.
- As an astronomy professor, I use Spacendar to start my daily lessons and allow students to comment in their own words an explanation of the photos.
